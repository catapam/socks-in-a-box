# User Experience

The goal on this was to be fun and match the tone the brand and business concept states.
<br>
In order to achieve that psychodelic colors were choosen as Palette and images that bring those same color and sentiment were developed.
<br>
The top menu is alive and gives feedback to the user when hoovered and/or clicked, showing were the user is at that exact moment by setting a different color to the page name on the menu. That menu is only visible on bigger screens, while it's substituted by a App style menu at the bottom of the screen, which also mark the page by changin icon colors. Both menus are always fixed, so user don't need to scroll to navigate to other pages.
<br>
The main content of home page also has some hover effects to bring the FUN sentiment set as main tone of the site, that same concept is brought to the Shop page, while About is more sober and focused in storytelling, and Support page focus in bringing the fun sentiment through colors and a easy going FAQ section.
<br>
All hero images have 3 different sizes, and media queries swapt between them to offer a better performance on all devices.
<br>
A quick support button is always fixed at the bottom-right corner of all pages (except support page), so user don't need to navigate to support page if they need to contact the team quickly.
<br>
Support form is added to the body of Support page, after the FAQ section, while the quick support button is removed. That is intentional to make the users check FAQ section before submitting a form on that page.
<br>
Submitting a support forms, will redirect the user to a 'Thank you' page, which will be visible for 7 seconds before automatically redirecting the user back to home page.
<br>
Shop page has a toggle where user can switch between annual and monthly plan, toggling it gives the user feedback changing the price the billing cycle and removing the offer if 'Annual' is selected.
<br>
Clicking on the subscribe buttons from shop page, open a pop-up, with blurred background, to keep the user focused on that form while creating their account. Once the form is submitted, the user is redirected to a 'Welcome' page, with instructions on how to access the account and download the app, which will be visible for 7 seconds before automatically redirecting the user back to home page. 
<br>
Accessing non-existent pages will throw a custom 404 error page which allows navigation using the default menus, or will automatically redirect the user back to home page after 7 seconds.

# Design

## Color scheme

* The color scheme was created based on initial image concepts generated by [Dall-e AI by ChatGPT](https://openai.com/dall-e-3);
* My script to the AI was to generate psychodelic images of socks rainning above a city, something similar to the current hero image on the site. The colors used were shades of Pink, dark blue, cian, yellow and orange.
* The final choice was made in [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) during the logo creation and later added to [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to create the palette:
